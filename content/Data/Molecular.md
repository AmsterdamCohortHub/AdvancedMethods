Molecular data in medicine and public health encompasses information about the structure, function, and interactions of molecules within living organisms. This data can be either cross-sectional (e.g., a single genetic test to identify a disease-causing mutation) or longitudinal (e.g., tracking changes in gene expression over time to monitor disease progression).
