Imaging data in medicine and public health encompasses a wide range of technologies used to visualize the internal structures and functions of the human body, as well as populations and environments. This data can be either cross-sectional (single time point), such as a single MRI scan of a patient's brain, or longitudinal (collected over time), like a series of X-rays tracking the healing of a broken bone.
