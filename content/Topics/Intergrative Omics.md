Integrative omics is a field of study that combines and analyzes data from multiple omics disciplines, such as genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and lipidomics. Unlike individual omics fields that focus on a single type of biomolecule, integrative omics aims to understand the complex interactions and relationships between different molecular layers within an organism.
