Target trial emulation is a statistical approach that uses observational data to estimate the causal effects of interventions as if they were studied in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). It involves designing a hypothetical "target trial" and then analyzing the observational data to mimic the conditions of that trial as closely as possible.
