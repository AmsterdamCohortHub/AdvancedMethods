Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) are a powerful framework for representing complex systems with uncertain relationships. They combine graph theory with probability theory to visually depict dependencies between variables and reason about their probabilities. PGMs find applications in various domains, such as medical diagnosis, image processing, and natural language processing.
