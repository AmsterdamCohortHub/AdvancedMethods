Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are observational studies that investigate the entire genome to identify genetic variants associated with specific traits or diseases. By comparing the genomes of individuals with and without a particular condition, researchers can pinpoint genetic markers that may contribute to the risk or development of the disease. GWAS have been instrumental in unraveling the genetic basis of various complex traits and diseases, leading to new insights into their underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.
