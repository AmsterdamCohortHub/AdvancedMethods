Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are a class of algorithms used to sample from complex probability distributions. They are widely used in Bayesian statistics for estimating model parameters and making predictions. MCMC methods construct a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, allowing for efficient sampling even when direct sampling is intractable.
