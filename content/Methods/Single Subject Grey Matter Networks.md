Single Subject Grey Matter Networks (SSGMN) is a method in neuroscience that uses neuroimaging data, primarily from MRI scans, to construct a detailed map of the brain's structural connections for each individual. This involves segmenting the brain into distinct regions based on their gray matter composition and then identifying the white matter pathways that connect these regions. The resulting map, often represented as a network graph, provides insights into the unique organization and connectivity patterns of an individual's brain
