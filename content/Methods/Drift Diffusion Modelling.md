Drift diffusion modeling, a mathematical framework inspired by neuroscience, simulates decision-making by considering how evidence accumulates and the impact of randomness on choices. This model has diverse applications in healthcare, biology, and public health, shedding light on how physicians diagnose, patients decide on treatments, organisms make choices in uncertain environments, and individuals respond to public health interventions.
