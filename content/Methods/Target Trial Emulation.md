Target Trial Emulation (TTE) is a methodological framework for designing and analyzing observational studies to mimic randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as closely as possible. By explicitly defining a hypothetical RCT protocol (the "target trial"), researchers can systematically apply design principles and analysis techniques from RCTs to observational data, aiming to minimize bias and improve the validity of causal inferences. TTE has gained popularity in various fields, including medicine, epidemiology, and social sciences.
