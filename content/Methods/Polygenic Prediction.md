Polygenic prediction is a method of estimating an individual's genetic predisposition to a particular trait or disease based on the combined effects of multiple genetic variants across the genome. It utilizes data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to calculate a polygenic risk score (PRS), which summarizes an individual's genetic risk based on their specific genetic profile. Polygenic prediction is increasingly used in research and clinical settings to identify individuals at higher risk of developing certain conditions, potentially leading to early intervention and personalized treatment.
