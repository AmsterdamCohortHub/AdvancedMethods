Dynamic Prediction refers to the modeling and forecasting of outcomes that change over time. Unlike static prediction, which relies on fixed input features, dynamic prediction incorporates evolving information to update predictions continuously. This approach is invaluable in fields like healthcare, where accurate forecasts of time-varying phenomena are crucial for decision-making.
