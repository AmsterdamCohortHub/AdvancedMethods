Response Surface Analysis (RSA), also known as Response Surface Methodology (RSM), is a statistical technique used in healthcare to model and optimize complex relationships between multiple input variables (factors) and one or more output variables (responses). In the context of healthcare, these factors could represent different treatment options, drug dosages, or patient characteristics, while the responses could be measures of treatment efficacy, side effects, or patient satisfaction.
